# TO-DO-List-App
 This is a To-Do List web app where users can add, mark, and delete tasks. Tasks are added via an input box and can be marked as completed/incomplete by clicking on them. The app includes a close icon to delete tasks. The To-Do List is saved using Local Storage, allowing users to retrieve their list even after closing and reopening their browser.
